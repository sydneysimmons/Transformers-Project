# Transformers-Project
### Overview
**Context:** For people interested in sports, there are many sport seasons and games happening at one time. We wanted to use Transformers to build models that would help people aggregate information quickly for any sport event.

**Approach:** We wanted to use Transformers to not only give users a summary of a sporting event that they are interested in, but also allow them to ask questions about an event and get quick statistics that they are interested in. Therefore, we researched and applied 3 of the Transformer pipelines in Hugging Face: 
1. Summarization Pipeline
2. Question Answering
3. Table Question Answering

**Testing:** We tested our models to start on data and articles from the 2022 Superbowl. 

**Potential Use Cases:** Our models could be used for the average sport enthusiast up to a sports commentator that needs a quick summary or information that happened in a sporting event. Instead of reading an entire article or researching statistics about a game in depth, a user can link an article or a table to our Transformer tools and quickly see what happened in a game.

### Critical Analysis
**Limitations:**
With more time, we would love to test our model on many sporting events and see how it performs across sports and different types of articles.
